# Safari_Haven_Zoo_Project
End-to-end data analytics project showcasing my skills. Utilized DBDiagram.com for database design, Mockaro.com for mock data, SSIS for data flow, SQL Server for database creation and reports, and Tableau for data visualization

Purpose of the Project: This is an end-to-end data analytics project designed to showcase my  skills. I created a database design, generated realistic mock data, imported that data into SQL Server, created SQL reports to extract insights, and finally created reports in Tableau.

Technologies Used: I  used a variety of tools for this project:

DBDiagram.com for designing your database
Mockaro.com for creating realistic mock data based on the database
SSIS for creating a data flow to move the mock data into staging tables
SQL Server for creating your working database from the DBDiagram.com design, migrating data from the staging database to the working database, and creating SQL reports
Tableau for creating data visualizations based on the SQL reports
